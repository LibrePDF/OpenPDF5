## Why OpenPDF5? ##
OpenPDF5 is a fork of iText 5, maintained in accordance with the AGPL open source license.
This fork has been created to ensure that iText 5 will stay maintained, since the iText company
has decided to deprecate iText 5. This ensures that users of iText 5 will get security updates forever.

We encourage users of OpenPDF5 and iText5, to "upgrade" to OpenPDF: https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF
